  Hey there! I’m <b>KC</b> — a <b>UI/UX Designer</b> and <b>Frontend Developer</b> who loves blending art and logic ✨

I bring ideas to life through **human-centered design** and **clean, responsive code**.
Whether it’s crafting wireframes in **Figma** or building sleek interfaces with **React + Tailwind**, I live for the magic that happens when design meets development 💖
